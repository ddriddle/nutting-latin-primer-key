1. Then Quintus said to Marcus, "The strong sailor sent me into the boat and frightened my monkey in the sand."
2. "When Claudia had come with me from the garden," said Julia, "she gave berries and apples to Marcus' monkey."

3. "Cūr in areā sedēs, Mārce?"  inquit Quintus; "ut vulpēculās videās? Vulpēculae in silvīs nunc sunt; sed mox multae in agrīs erunt."
