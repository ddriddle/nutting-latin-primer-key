1. What do you see in the sky, Marcus? I see the moon and the stars.
2. Quintus, when he was in my boat, threw stones into the water.
3. Boys, the farmers gave money to you all, that you would hold the horses in the road.
4. Your little fox, Julia, found many grapes in the yard yesterday. Today he found berries; for I have filled the little basket.

1. Then Quintus said to Marcus, "The strong sailor sent me into the boat and frightened my monkey in the sand."
2. "When Claudia had come with me from the garden," said Julia, "she gave berries and apples to Marcus' monkey."
3. "Where is the dolls' bed, girls?" asked Marcella. "The bed is in the tent," answered the girls; "therefore we will sit there with the dolls."
4. "Once upon a time," said the lazy sailor, "when the moon was in the sky, the she-bear came out of the cave and slew the poor little fox."

3. "Cūr in areā sedēs, Mārcus?"  inquit Quintus; "ut vulpēculās vidissēs? Vulpeculae in silvīs iam sunt; sed mox multae in agrīs erunt."
