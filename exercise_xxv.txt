1. "For a long time, we did not find bears," said the farmer. "Then many burst out of the big cave, and frightened the strong sailors; and my horse, when he saw the she-bears, he ran out of the forest and carried me through the fields quickly."
2. "What did you give to Marcus, my son?" asked the lazy sailor. "I gave a wicked little fox to Marcus," said the son; "but Marcus had given me money."
3. "The moon is a large star," said Claudia. "The moon is in the sky," said Quintus; "but it is not a star."
4. "Marcus, when he had run through the yard into the garden," said Marcella, "he sent us into a little boat with Claudia because he had seen a large wolf in the field."

2. "Hodiē cum in silvīs sederem," inquit Quīntus Iūliae, "ursam vīdī. Itaque celeriter cucurrī ut Mārcum monērem; sed ē spelūncā ērūperat et in cymbam nautārum iērat. 
3. Tum inquit Claudia, "Cum nautae in harēnā diu sēdissent, in agrum vēnērunt et nōs in āream mīsērunt."
4. "Cum sīmia in terram cecidisset," inquit Quintus, "is in caveam celeriter cucurrit et ibi diū sēdit. Nunc vulpēculās vestrās timet, puerī."
